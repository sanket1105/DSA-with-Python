In this we are creating an outer array and we are updating the elements i to it.
Say first element, 2 conditions: taken or rejected
Then for 2nd element from the original list, you will slelect and reject the elements from the outer list.

So everytime you will always update the outer list and will print the outer list.

whatever the size of the outer list, that many elements you are adding to the outer list
See the explaination from Kunal.
